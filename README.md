# interIITDroneOptimization

We solved the problem statement provided to us during the Inter-IIT competition.It was based on finding the most optimal paths and 
then generating the csv file for the speed as well as the x,y and z coordinate of given different types of drones(with different speed as well as carrying capacity)
delivering different packages as well as preventing obstacles coming in the way and optimizing the charge stations nearby.

The code is written in c++ mainly.
There are still some optimizations that can be done to make it better. So all the very best to everyone who would like to contribute and make it better:)
